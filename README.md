# SITH-CLI

> SITH is a Wifi Signal Strength Analyzer CLI app

## Intro

```sh
# Install
npm install -g sith-cli

# Run it!
sith
```


## Known limitations
Right now SITH will have an undefined behavior if more than one Wifi card
is enabled/transmiting. Potentially this is something we are going to be fixing in the future.
